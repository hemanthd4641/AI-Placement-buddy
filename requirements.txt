## Notes:
# - Some libraries (e.g., torch, transformers) are pulled in by sentence-transformers as dependencies.
# - pdfminer, librosa, speech/audio, opencv, scikit-learn and other optional items were removed because the
#   repository does not import them directly. Re-add them if you rely on features that require them.
